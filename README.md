## 🛠️ Features

* **Browse Anime**: View a list of available anime series.
* **Episode Index**: Access episodes through direct links.
* **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
* **Minimalist Interface**: Focused on functionality with a clean layout.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run BentoRoll locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vystelior/bentoroll.github.io.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd bentoroll.github.io
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.

No additional setup is required; the site is entirely static.

## 📁 Data Structure

The `data/` directory contains JSON or CSV files with metadata for each anime series. Each file should include:

```json
{
  "series": "Naruto",
  "episodes": [
    {
      "episode": 1,
      "title": "Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!",
      "link": "https://drive.google.com/...",
      "cover": "https://..."
    }
  ]
}
```

This structure allows for easy addition of new series and episodes.

## 🧪 Development Notes

* **HTML**: Utilizes semantic tags for better accessibility.
* **CSS**: Written in plain CSS; consider using preprocessors like SASS for larger projects.
* **JavaScript**: Functions are modular; consider using ES6 modules for better maintainability.


## 🎓 Learning Outcome: Provider Adapter Demo

This project now includes a **provider adapter pattern** in `src/scripts/provider-adapters.js` that demonstrates how to integrate multiple APIs behind one interface.

### What you can learn

- How to define a common adapter contract (`getWatchLinks`) for different providers.
- How to normalize output into one shape (`{ source, label, href, type }`).
- How to run providers with fallback priority (`official -> search fallback`).
- How to add a mock adapter for safe local demos.

### Demo mode

Open a watch URL with `demo=1` to force mock provider output and inspect the integration flow:

```text
watch.html?series=gachiakuta&season=1&episode=1&version=en&demo=1
```

In normal mode, the page tries Jikan official provider metadata first, then falls back to legal discovery links.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Implement search and filtering capabilities.
* Add a "Continue Watching" feature using browser storage.
* Integrate a backend API for dynamic content management.
* Enhance mobile responsiveness and performance.
